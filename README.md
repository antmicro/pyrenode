# Pyrenode

Copyright (c) 2020-2022 Antmicro

A rudimentary Python library to talk to Renode programatically.

## Version 1.0

This is on the master branch. See README there for details. It was necessary for enabling demos like the [Google Colab integation](https://github.com/antmicro/tensorflow-arduino-examples).

## Version 2.0

This branch contains a seed for the "new" pyrenode, using Robot remote keyword execution.
It's the new stuff bolted onto original pyrenode, so it's not super neat.

### Installing

```
pip install robotframework
# and you need Renode too of course!
```

## Running an example

```
./example.py
```

## TODO

* [ ] Better error handling
